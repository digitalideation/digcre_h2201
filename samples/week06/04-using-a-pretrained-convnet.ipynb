        "generic model of our visual world, and hence its features can prove useful for many different computer vision problems, even though these \n",
        "new problems might involve completely different classes from those of the original task. For instance, one might train a network on \n",

        "layers, and they end with a densely-connected classifier. The first part is called the \"convolutional base\" of the model. In the case of \n",
        "convnets, \"feature extraction\" will simply consist of taking the convolutional base of a previously-trained network, running the new data \n",
        "through it, and training a new classifier on top of the output.\n",

        "\n",
        "Why only reuse the convolutional base? Could we reuse the densely-connected classifier as well? In general, it should be avoided. The \n",
        "reason is simply that the representations learned by the convolutional base are likely to be more generic and therefore more reusable: the \n",
        "feature maps of a convnet are presence maps of generic concepts over a picture, which is likely to be useful regardless of the computer \n",
        "vision problem at hand. On the other end, the representations learned by the classifier will necessarily be very specific to the set of \n",
        "classes that the model was trained on -- they will only contain information about the presence probability of this or that class in the \n",
        "entire picture. Additionally, representations found in densely-connected layers no longer contain any information about _where_ objects are \n",
        "located in the input image: these layers get rid of the notion of space, whereas the object location is still described by convolutional \n",
        "feature maps. For problems where object location matters, densely-connected features would be largely useless.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that the level of generality (and therefore reusability) of the representations extracted by specific convolution layers depends on \n",
        "the depth of the layer in the model. Layers that come earlier in the model extract local, highly generic feature maps (such as visual \n",
        "edges, colors, and textures), while layers higher-up extract more abstract concepts (such as \"cat ear\" or \"dog eye\"). So if your new \n",
        "dataset differs a lot from the dataset that the original model was trained on, you may be better off using only the first few layers of the \n",
