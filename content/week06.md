## Intro

This week we will: 
+ Experiment with ML5js
+ Look at some interesting usage of Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets or CNN) 
+ Start learning about Reccurrent Neural Networks (RNN) in their different forms.


## Resources

+ [ML5 - Examples](https://ml5-fellowship-2020.github.io/examples/) (by [Andreas Refsgaard](https://github.com/AndreasRef))
+ [ML5 - Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26uABexmOX4&feature=youtu.be&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6YPSwT06y_AEYTqIwbeam3y)

## Weekly task

Run and discuss the notebooks in `comppx_h2101/samples/notebooks`. We will do that part in class most likely.

Create a small experiment using a generative RNN. Some ideas:

+ Music player 
+ A platform game level
